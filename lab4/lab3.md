1- Write a program that receives a positive integer 𝑛 > 2, then your program should read 𝑛
integers. There is only one integer that is unique in this list. Your program should find that value
and print it. Check the samples for clarification.
Sample 1:
Input
5
18 20 9 20 9
Output
The unique number = 18
Sample 2:
Input
10
7 4 4 5 13 20 4 5 7 20
Output
The unique number = 13
2 – Write a program that receives a positive integer 𝑛 > 1. Then, it reads 𝑛 real numbers. Your
program should find the two numbers among these numbers that have the minimum difference. In
other words, find 𝑥 and 𝑦 in the array such that |𝑥 − 𝑦| is minimized. If there are more than one
pair with minimum difference, print the one that has smaller numbers. Check samples for
clarification.
Sample 1:
Input
5
56.17 61.15 14.56 13.21 29.92
Output
13.21 14.56
Sample 2:
Input
7
19.98 20.01 20.02 18.96 20.20 20.21
Output
20.01 20.02
3- Write a program that receives two strings and checks if they are anagram of each other. Two
strings are anagram, if they contain exactly the same characters. Upper case and lower case letters
are not the same in this problem. Check the samples for clarification.
Sample 1:
Input
rah1im&*
*hmi1&ra
Output
These strings are anagram.
Sample 2:
Input
axy3y%3
33ax%
Output
These strings are not anagram.
Sample 3:
Input
bmjarA
AmjArb
Output
These strings are not anagram.
